        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Embarking on the path of becoming a self-taught developer can be both challenging and rewarding. As someone who has personally experienced the highs and lows of this journey, I understand the struggles and limitations that come with it. In this blog post, I want to share some valuable tips and resources that have helped me along the way. Despite working with limited resources, such as using a smartphone instead of a laptop or PC, I've managed to create web apps and a personal portfolio website. If I can do it, so can you!

        <h2>Embrace Mistakes: Turning Errors into Learning Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Programming is a field where mistakes are inevitable, and that's okay! Each error encountered is an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. Here are a few tips for embracing mistakes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Don't be afraid to make mistakes.</b> Everyone makes mistakes when they're learning to code. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.</li>
            <li><b>Don't take mistakes personally.</b> Mistakes are not a reflection of your intelligence or ability. They're simply a part of the learning process.</li>
            <li><b>Use mistakes as an opportunity to learn.</b> When you make a mistake, take the time to understand why you made the mistake and how you can avoid making it in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Utilize Online Resources</h2>
